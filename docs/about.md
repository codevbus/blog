# About

I'm a DevOps engineer based out of Grand Rapids, MI.

I've worked with global-scale and startup companies, focusing on engineering ops, security, and automating the software lifecycle.

I've been fully remote since 2017; it's an integral of my work/life balance and workflow.

When it comes to engineering and software infrastructure, I prefer simplicity, modularity, and robustness.

Complexity and brittleness are code smells. I also create technical content. Infrequently on the blog, often elsewhere.

Right now I'm thinking about AI, OSS, and how to build simple things that are nice.
