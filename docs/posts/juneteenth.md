Rather than resuming my usual cadence of content posts, I thought it would be better to follow up on my last post with a similar theme.

Today marks the anniversary of the "end" of slavery. While it's a positive direction that our country generally decided it was no longer appropriate to "own" another human being, the legacy of racism obviously lives on today.
