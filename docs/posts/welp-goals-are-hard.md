So yeah, as it turns out, goals are hard.

A month ago, I set out some [loosely defined goals for 2021](https://mikevanbuskirk.io/posts/its-been-awhile/).

How is it going, you ask?

Well, this is the first post in the month since I wrote that post, the number of Twitter followers I have are exactly the same, and I haven't launched any sites or products.

Not exactly a hot start to the year.

A tweet I saw recently made me think that it might be more about "systems" instead of "goals":

(the whole thread is gold, and I highly recommend giving Pete a follow)

So, rather than making some fixed goals, and feeling bad when I don't hit them, I think I should probably aim to do "something" each day, and only work to ensure it's productive and generally aligned to some "end state".

For example: learning a new framework or tool isn't necessarily a goal, but choosing to learn something that might be used as part of a stack for a launched product or project **is** moving the needle, albeit in a roundabout way.

Let's give systems a shot, and see how that works out.
