Following up on my previous post: <https://mikevanbuskirk.io/posts/new-site-launch/>, I've written another no code tutorial on Dev.to to further promote the future launch of: [nocodeautomation.io](https://nocodeautomation.io):

<https://dev.to/codevbus/graph-your-dev-to-metrics-with-no-code-2a5j>

This tutorial goes a little more in depth, showing how to do some simple time-series graphing of Dev.to post metrics using Airtable and Plotly.

As always, if you find this content interesting, please sign up on the [nocodeautomation.io](https://nocodeautomation.io) site for future updates ahead of the site launch.

Hope everyone is healthy and safe!
