Just a brief post to share something I've been working on/thinking about the past few weeks.

I've been experimenting with "No Code" tools recently, and I'm continually blown away by the flexibility and power they provide.

I'm launching a site dedicated to "No Code" tutorials, tips, tools, and news: <https://nocodeautomation.io>

The site isn't live yet, but I'll be sending updates and content to subscribed users. Please sign up if you think this might be useful or interesting, or if you know of someone who may.

I posted a tutorial on dev.to to help promote the kind of content that will be featured on the site:

<https://dev.to/codevbus/track-your-dev-to-metrics-with-no-code-2k5m>

Look for more updates in the future.

I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe!
