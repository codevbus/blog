It's been over two years since I last wrote a blog post here. A lot has changed since then, especially with the rise of AI and the proliferation of LLMs in the software engineering zeitgeist. 

I've wanted to take more time to write posts about things I'm learning or thinking about, but real life tends to conspire against those intentions. 

Either way, the first step (and something I've been meaning to do for a while) is to update the site design. Hugo was a great workhorse for a long time, but I finally started getting tired of the rough edges around documentation, theming, and the overall complexity of the engine.

One of the original things that attracted me to Hugo was also the ability to blog straight out of org-mode, but I ultimately stopped making use of that workflow. I still think org-mode is a great tool for writing and taking notes, but the org -> blog process was always a bit of a slog.

I decided to go with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). I'm just more familiar with the tooling and the documentation is a lot more straightforward. It's also dead simple and very lightweight. Hopefully the next step is to also write some posts to go along with it.
